# Experimental Volume Of Droplet

#### About the project

The project was developed for a personal application, but it might be useful for fellow researchers. It is supposed to analyse and calculate the volume of the resulting droplets of a dripping or jetting nozzle, from the images taken in an experimental setup. 

The image below shows the output plotting of a detached droplet, as a function of the internal inlet diameter. It is also shown the droplet's volume, as a function of the volume of a sphere with the internal inlet diameter.

>(10uls_6400fps_b_C001H001S0001000195) V/V0 = 45.07, measured in between z = 2.72 and z = 6.52.

#### Requirements before use

This project was developed for a specific application and it was not tested for a large database. 

#### How to use

For staters, 

###### Assumed that files with pictures are within sub directories of a main directory. Calibration directory starts with 'calibration'.
###### Picture is assumed to be completely vertical. Only necessary images in folder.
###### It is assumed that no other files besides photos and calibration directories are on the main directory
###### Assumed images are .tif
